# DynamicReasoning
Build 2 agents, 1 with static workflow and one with Dynamic Reasoning, measure the results

## Metrics

The `metrics.py` module tracks conversation statistics for both agents. It records turns, task completion, error count and placeholder CSAT scores. Each agent returns a summary dictionary after `converse` showing these metrics.
